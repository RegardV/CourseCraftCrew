### Added
- Created models.py with Pydantic models for course content structures
- Added TESTING_MODE toggle in settings.py for simplified test output vs. full courses
- Implemented PDF Builder Agent for PDF generation
- Created comprehensive tools.py with mock PubMed research, VADER sentiment analysis, and PDF generation
- Added streaming support (agent.run(stream=True)) for handling large outputs in full mode
- Implemented output directory structure for test PDFs (/output/YYYY-MM-DD/) and full course PDFs (/output/course_subject/course_topic/YYYY-MM-DD/)
- Created Phase 1 crew implementation with sequential task processing

### Updated
- Enhanced Manager Agent with phase coordination functionality
- Implemented Research Agent with PubMed integration (mock for testing)
- Added Content Curator Agent with VADER sentiment analysis
- Created Editor Agent for content refinement
- Updated main.py with two execution options (Manager-driven or Crew-driven)

### Fixed
- Ensured output directories are created if they don't exist

Phase 1 Implementation Complete
I've successfully implemented all components required for Phase 1 of the CourseCraft Crew project. The implementation is focused on text and image-based course creation with a testing mode that produces a 2-3 page PDF.

Components Implemented
Pydantic Models (models.py)

Created structured data models for course content validation
Includes models for research findings, course modules, and PDF content
Configuration Settings (config/settings.py)

Added TESTING_MODE toggle to switch between test (2-3 pages) and full course modes
Configured output paths for PDFs with appropriate naming conventions
Set up limits for testing mode (findings, modules, images)
Tools (tools/tools.py)

Implemented mock PubMed research functionality
Added VADER sentiment analysis for content tone
Created PDF generation using reportlab
Added DuckDB tool placeholder for the Manager Agent
Agents

Research Agent: Gathers evidence-based information on journaling for anxiety
Content Curator Agent: Organizes findings into structured course modules
Editor Agent: Refines content for clarity and engagement
PDF Builder Agent: Generates professional PDFs from course content
Manager Agent: Coordinates the workflow across all agents
Tasks and Workflow (tasks/phase1_tasks.py)

Defined specific tasks for each agent with detailed instructions
Created testing mode variations that limit content to 2-3 modules
Phase 1 Crew (crews/phase1_crew.py)

Implemented crew structure to coordinate agent collaboration
Added process_results function to handle task outputs and log completion
Main Script (main.py)

Updated with two execution options: Manager-driven or Crew-driven
Ensured NLTK resources are downloaded and output directories exist
Initialized LLM and environment setup
Changelog (changelog.md)

Created to track implementation changes and project evolution
Next Steps to Run the System
To run the system and generate a course PDF:

Set Up Environment

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source
 venv/bin/activate  
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
